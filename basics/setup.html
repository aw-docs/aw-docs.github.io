        <h1 id="title">Setting up the game</h1>

        <main id="content">
            <p> As Altos Wars is a 1v1 game, a server is needed so that you and
                whoever you are versing can play together. If you are both on the
                same network, you can set it up by entering the game menu and
                selecting Open to LAN. If you need help setting up a server check
                out the <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Setting_
                up_a_server"> official minecraft wiki's tutorial on setting up
                a server</a>.</p>
            <hr>
            <p> There are various things you must ensure when running the server.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure that the render distance is set to 16 chunks or higher
                    (this is so that certain command blocks placed very far away
                    still function)</li>
                <li>Ensure that command blocks are enabled in the server config
                </li>
                <li>The game difficulty should be set on easy</li>
                <li>Everyone should be set on adventure mode before the game starts
                </li>
                <li>Spawn protection should be off so that non-opped players can
                    interact with buttons</li>
            </ul>
            <figure>
            <img src="../images/nowhere.png" alt="A screenshot of a desert at night in minecraft" height="350" width="700">
            <figcaption>If you enter the world and spawn here make sure to kill
                yourself </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>If you enter the world and are placed in the middle of nowhere (like the image above),
                simply use the <code>/kill</code> command to kill yourself and you
                should respawn in the default spawn location (the starting lobby). Another
                important thing worth mentioning is that the game does not reset.
                Because of this, you should ensure that you have a clean copy of the save file
                stored somewhere on your computer, so that after the game has
                finished, you can simply override the old save file in the server
                to reset the game. </p>
