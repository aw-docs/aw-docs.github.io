        <h1 id="title">The currencies</h1>

        <main id="content">
            <p>There are three types of obtainable currencies in Altos Wars: EXP,
                gold and dark psyche. In this document we will be outlining ways
                to obtain these currencies, what you can buy with them and the
                conversion rates for trading one currency for another.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2> EXP </h2>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/currency-display.png" alt="A screenshot showing how to view the different currencies in the minecraft custom game Altos Wars">
                <figcaption>EXP is shown at the right hand scoreboard. Gold is shown when you hold tab between the player name and their connection status. </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>EXP is the least valuable currency in Altos Wars, however this
                does not make it the least important currency. EXP is obtained
                simply by killing zombies. For every zombie you kill, one EXP
                point is gained. You can view how much EXP you currently possess
                by checking out the scoreboard to the right (as shown in the figure above). Is is important to
                note that EXP in this case DOES NOT refer to exp in minecraft
                which you use for enchantments in DEFAULT minecraft. The exp bar
                in Altos Wars is used to count how many seconds the game has been
                running for. The current level displayed on the exp bar represents
                how many seconds the game has been running for. This is useful when
                you know all the timings of the mob spawns.</p>

            <p>EXP can be used to buy a wide range of items such as the core
                breaker or something simpler such as steak. Check out the
                <a href="../items/exp-items.html">EXP shop items </a> document to
                view the full list of all items. EXP is also the only currency that
                you can purchase enchantments with. To see the full list of
                enchantments obtainable via EXP, check out the document on
                <a href="../items/enchantments.html"> enchantment shop enchantments</a>.
                You can also convert 20EXP into a single point of dark psyche.
            </p>
            <h2>Gold</h2>
            <p>Gold is obtained by killing other players. For every player kill
                you will obtain one gold. Unlike other currencies, gold can be
                lost. For every death, you lose one gold, however if you have zero
                gold, you will lose none. This is important to consider when saving
                up gold to buy particular gold items. You can view gold by holding
                tab. Gold is displayed between the player name and your connection
                status (as seen in the figure above). Gold can be converted to
                5EXP as shown in the figure below. This is sometimes a good idea
                if you know you are going to die. Gold is used to buy some of the
                most important items in the game such as the spawn blockers and
                the Core Breaker 2. To view the full list of obtainable gold items
                check out the <a href="../items/gold-items.html">gold shop items </a> document.

            </figure>
            <h2>Dark psyche</h2>
            <p>Unlike the currencies listed above, obtaining dark psyche is much
                more complicated and requires multiple steps. One way to acquire
                dark psyche is by simply converting 20EXP to dark psyche in the
                dark psyche shop, however this is inefficient as that EXP could be
                used for enchantments. The primary method of achieving dark psyche
                involves killing a mob called the dark spirits. These are basically
                spiders with several buffs and spawn on both sides of the map at
                regular intervals. The dark spirits drop an item called dark
                essence. Dark essence is basically just a block of coal. Dark
                essence can be converted to dark psyche by placing it on the nether
                brick inside the underground layer of the ancient tree, as shown
                in the figure below. Placing a single block of dark essence on the
                nether brick converts it dark psyche and destroys that block.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/convert.png" alt="A screenshot showing the place where you convert dark essence into dark psyche">
                <figcaption>Place dark essence onto the nether brick to convert it
                    into dark essence. This will destroy it in the process. This
                    area is located under the trapdoor in the ancient tree </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p> To find out more information about dark spirits, check out the
                document on <a href="../mobs/dark-spirit.html">dark spirits </a>.
                To find out more about the ancient tree, check out the document on
                <a href="../map-components/tree.html">the ancient tree</a>. Now
                that we've discussed how to obtain this unique currency, it's time
                to discuss what dark psyche is used for. Dark psyche is used to
                purchase some of the most interesting items in the game called
                dark pscyhe items. These are not normal items; dark psyche items
                have their own unique properties. Most of the time these properties
                are positive such as extra damage, but some items offer benefits
                at a cost. Dark psyche items play a large role in Altos Wars,
                sometimes deciding who wins or not. To see the full list of dark
                psyche items, check out the <a href="../items/dark-items.html">
