        <h1 id="title">Brief overview of the game</h1>

        <main id="content">
            <p>Now that you know <a href="setup.html"> how to setup the game</a>,
                you are finally ready to begin playing. However, before you dive
                in,you first must know some rudimentary knowledge of how the game
                works. This document will give you the <em>minimum</em>
                knowledge required to play the game, however there is still <em>a
                lot</em> more left to learn.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>The main premise</h2>
            <p>Two teams, the Hunters and the Altos who have invaded the Hunter's
                land, must battle each other out in a 1v1 pvp battle, while attempting
                to destroy each other's cores to ultimately win the game.
                Both players are assisted with unique items that they can buy along
                the way at various stores.
                In addition to this, both players play as one of the various
                classes which all have their unique perks and gimmicks giving them
                unique playstyles.
                The first person that can finally kill off a player without them
                respawning is crowned victor. Players will continually respawn
                while their core is still present. You may then be wondering,
                what is this core, and how do I destroy it? <p>
                <h2>The core </h2>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/core.png" alt="A screenshot of two obsidian blocks stacked on top of each other in minecraft">
                <figcaption>The Hunters core</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The core is simply two obsidian blocks stacked on top of each
                other as seen in the figure above. It is located in the respective player's base right in front of their spawn pad. Once the player's core is
                fully destroyed by breaking both obsidian blocks, that player
                will no longer be able to respawn. Once that player has died,
                the game ends and the opposing player wins. While the core is
                still alive, the player will continue to respawn in their spawn
                pad, however there is a short delay of a few seconds. There are
                only two items in the game that can destroy the core: a diamond
                pickaxe called the Core Breaker and an enchanted diamond pickaxe
                called the Core Breaker 2. The Core Breaker can be purchased at
                the EXP shop while the Core Breaker 2 can be purchased at the gold
                shop. We will now go over a brief overview of the currencies and
                items in the game. For further information about the core, check
                out the document on <a href="../map-components/base.html"> the
                bases</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>The currencies, items and shops</h2>
            <figure>
                <img src="../images/exp-shop2.png" alt="A screenshot of the EXP shop in the minecraft custom game Altos Wars">
                <figcaption>The EXP shop near the Altos base with shopkeeper Moum</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>As previously discussed, you will either need EXP or gold to
                purchase either of the core breakers so that you can defeat your
                enemy. EXP is simply acquired by killing zombies. For every zombie
                you kill you gain exactly one EXP. Gold is simply acquired by
                killing the other player. Every time you kill the other player you
                gain one gold. However, <strong> if you die you lose one gold </strong>. Of course, if you have 0 gold you will not lose any. But, keep this in mind
                when saving up for Core Breaker 2 which costs 5 gold. The core
                breaker in the EXP shop costs only 13exp. Each team has their own
                EXP and gold shops, however any team can buy items from any shop.
                If you want to find out more about all the EXP shop items available
                check out the document on <a href="../items/exp-items.html"> EXP shop items </a>.
                If you want to find out more about all the gold shop items available
                check out the document on <a href="../items/gold-items.html">gold shop items </a>.
                Gold and EXP aren't the only currencies in the game; there is also
                dark psyche which is a currency a bit more tricky to explain. Dark
                psyche plays an extremely important role in the game, so it's
                highly suggested that you read the full document on <a href="currency.html"> the currencies </a>.
                It is also important to understand the mobs, as you obtain most
                currencies by killing mobs in the game. Make sure to check out
                the <a href="../index.html#mobs"> mobs section on the home page</a>
                to learn about all the different types of mobs.

            </p>
            <p> Congratulations, you now understand how to win the game! However,
                there is <em>so much more</em> to learn. Make sure to return to the
                <a href="../index.html"> homepage </a> and read through all the
                documents to gain a better understanding of the game. You do not
                need to read through them all in one sitting, actually it is
                preferred that you go out and play the game and come back here
                occasionally to strengthen your understanding of the game. This is
                probably the most enjoyable and most effective way to learn.
                Anyways, that's the end of the overview, have fun reading through
                the rest of these docs, and most importantly, have fun playing the
                game itself!
